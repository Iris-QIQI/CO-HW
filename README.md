# CO-HW
MATLAB Code & Data
## Introduction

# Co-occurred heatwaves (CO-HWs)
The CO-HW is defined as the day when MHW and THW co-occur in the coastal ocean and its surrounding continent. The single event refers to the isolated MHW/THW. The consecutive CO-HW days as a CO-HW event, but do not require a minimum number of consecutive days, that is, if a single day with MHW and THW co-occur, it can still be considered a CO-HW event.
# Marine heatwaves (MHWs):
The MHW is an anomalously warm water event that persists for five or more days, with SST exceeding the 90th percentile threshold calculated using an 11-day window (Hobday et al.,2016).
# Terrestrial heatwaves (THWs):
The THW is a period when the 2 m temperature maximum is above its 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, calculated based on a 15-day window (Alexander & Perkins, 2013).

The data used to draw Figure 1-8 is stored separately in the corresponding .mat file.
Codes are written in MATLAB.
